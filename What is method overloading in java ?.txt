A class having two or more methods with same name but with different arguments then we say that those
methods are overloaded. Static polymorphism is achieved in java using method overloading.
Method overloading is used when we want the methods to perform similar tasks but with different inputs
or values. When an overloaded method is invoked java first checks the method name, and the number of
arguments ,type of arguments; based on this compiler executes this method.
Compiler decides which method to call at compile time. By using overloading static polymorphism or static
binding can be achieved in java.
Note : Return type is not part of method signature. we may have methods with different return types but
return type alone is not sufficient to call a method in java.
