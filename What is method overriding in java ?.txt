If we have methods with same signature (same name, same signature, same return type) in super class
and subclass then we say
subclass method is overridden by superclass.
When to use overriding in java
If we want same method with different behaviour in superclass and subclass then we go for overriding.
When we call overridden method with subclass reference subclass method is called hiding the superclass
method.
