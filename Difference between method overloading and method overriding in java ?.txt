# Method Overloading
1) Method Overloading occurs with in the same class
2) Since it involves with only one class inheritance is not involved.
3) In overloading return type need not be the same
4) Parameters must be different when we do overloading
5) Static polymorphism can be acheived using method overloading
6) In overloading one method canâ€™t hide the another

1) Method Overriding occurs between two classes superclass and subclass
2) Since method overriding occurs between superclass and subclass inheritance is involved.
3) In overriding return type must be same.
4) Parameters must be same.
5) Dynamic polymorphism can be acheived using method overriding.
