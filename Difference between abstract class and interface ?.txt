# Interface
1) Interface contains only abstract methods
2) Access Specifiers for methods in interface must be public

# Abstract Class
1) Abstract class can contain abstract methods, concrete methods or both
2) Except private we can have any access specifier for methods in abstract class.
3) Except private variables can have any access specifiers
4) We cannot achieve multiple inheritance using abstract class.
5) To implement an interface we use implements keyword
